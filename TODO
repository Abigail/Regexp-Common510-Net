     - RFC 1035 and 2181 mention the domain name is limited
       to 255 characters. Currently, the pattern does not check
       for this. (But there is a TODO test).

     - From RFC 4343:
        5. Internationalized Domain Names
	   A scheme has been adopted for "internationalized domain names" and
           "internationalized labels" as described in [RFC3490, RFC3454,
           RFC3491, and RFC3492].  It makes most of [UNICODE] available through
           a separate application level transformation from internationalized
           domain name to DNS domain name and from DNS domain name to
	   internationalized domain name.  Any case insensitivity that
           internationalized domain names and labels have varies depending on
           the script and is handled entirely as part of the transformation
           described in [RFC3454] and [RFC3491], which should be seen for
           further details. This is not a part of the DNS as standardized in
           STD 13.
